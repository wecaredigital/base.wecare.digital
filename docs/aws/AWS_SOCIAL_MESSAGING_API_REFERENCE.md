The

         all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see
AWS Service Endpoints

AWS End User Messaging endpoints and quotas
in the AWS General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see

in the AWS General
         Reference.
In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
         Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
         low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability
         Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also
         minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available
         in each Region, see
AWS Global Infrastructure.
